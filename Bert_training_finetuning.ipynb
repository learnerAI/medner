Patient presented on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] s/p fall at her group home and found to be hypotensive secondary to dehydration and atenolol intake. Of note, she has had multiple admissions in the past for lightheadness and was admitted to [**Hospital[NUM] [NUM]**] for the same complaint from [**Date range ([NUM]) [NUM]**]. At that time the patient fell in the bathroom and hit the back of her head on her bath tub. She recalls having a head CT which was negative. Up to and throughout that hospitalization she had nausea and vomiting which only resolved on her day prior to discharge. After discharge she was feeling well and tolerating PO's. She had occassional feelings of diziness, but thought it was due to the psychosocial stress over the murder of her grandson's girlfriend. She continued to eat and drink well with no diarrhea, melena, hematochezia. She denied headache but has been taking Motrin [NUM]mg qid for left hip pain. She decided to take her Atenolol which she had taken in the past but was no longer taking on the morning of admission. The diziness progressed and she felt presyncopal and fell onto her backside with her left foot underneath her. She had no fecal or urinary incontinence. In [**Doctor First Name [NUM]**], her SBP was in the [NUM]'s and she was given [NUM] liter fluid with good response. It was initially thought to be due to atenolol ovedose and she was given glucagon and calcium gluconate with no further improvement. Pt complained of foot pain and had negative plain x-ray of her foot, but after she was given [NUM]mg of morphine her SBP's decreased to to [NUM]'s which didn't respond to Narcan so decision was made for ICU admission.

Electrolytes: Sodium [NUM], potassium [NUM].[NUM], chloride [NUM], bicarbonate [NUM], BUN [NUM], creatinine [NUM].[NUM], glucose [NUM]. HOSPITAL COURSE: [NUM]. Cardiovascular: Patient presented with prior poor control of his hypertension. He was restarted on all of his regular antihypertensive medications including Lopressor, nifedipine, lisinopril, and clonidine, and for poor control of his blood pressure, hydralazine and labetalol prn were added. As further history was gathered during his hospital stay indicated that the patient's symptoms may have been preceded by micturition. The possibility of an intracystic pheochromocytoma was considered despite the fact that the patient has had negative urine metanephrines in the past. To evaluate this possibility further, a MIBG scan was scheduled for the following week. In preparation for this MIBG scan, the patient was weaned off his alpha and calcium-channel blockers as this was necessary for an accurate [**Location (un) [NUM]**]. During this time, his blood pressure remained quite labile. The first labetalol and hydralazine were used for control, but after further episodes of poorly controlled hypertension, nitroglycerin IV drip was used as needed. Patient was transferred to the West Campus in preparation for this MIBG scan. As his blood pressure continued to be quite labile, it was clear that closer monitoring and better control of his blood pressure was indicated, therefore the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name [NUM]**] on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**], where a Nipride drip was started. Patient was weaned off all of his calcium-channel blockers, alpha blockers, and beta blockers in preparation for the MIBG scan, which occurred on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] and [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]. Patient was transferred back to Medicine floor on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] and on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**], his blood pressure was well controlled on his regular oral antihypertensive regimen. The results of the MIBG scan were pending at the time of discharge. [NUM]. Endocrine: Patient has a history of type [NUM] diabetes. He was continued on his regular glargine dose with regular insulin-sliding scale to cover for elevated blood sugars, fingersticks continued q.i.d. [NUM]. Gastroparesis: When the patient was taking p.o. diet, he was continued on his regular regimen per treatment of his gastroparesis including erythromycin, Reglan, and famotidine, antiemetics including Zofran were also used to control intermittent nausea. [NUM]. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition: Patient was advanced slowly to his regular diet on admission after having a history of nausea and vomiting. As his symptoms were thought to sometimes follow eating he was made NPO to evaluate this possible connection. During this time the patient received PPN and then TPN and then nutrition consultation on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]. He resumed his regular diabetic diet. IV fluids were often administered during his hospital stay to address increase in creatinine. [NUM]. Renal: Patient has a baseline creatinine of [NUM].[NUM] to [NUM].[NUM]. During his hospital stay, his creatinine rose up to [NUM].[NUM]. IV fluids were administered to address this renal failure. Prerenal etiology was initially suspected but was not supported by FENa calculation as creatinine elevation was thought to be due to hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy. At the time of discharge, his creatinine had trended towards baseline. [NUM]. Intravenous access: Patient had a Port-A-Cath and a right IJ line placed during his hospital stay. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile with blood pressure well controlled on p.o. medications. Patient is asymptomatic. DISCHARGE STATUS: Patient is being discharged to home.

He had been discharged from [**Hospital[NUM] [NUM]**] in February to his parent's house. while there he was disruptive. He destroyed property and OD'd on Motrin. His parents got a restraining order against him and he moved [**Street Address [NUM]**] In. He was admitted to [**Hospital[NUM] [NUM]**] briefly from [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] to [NUM] due to decreased responsiveness. Full medical workup was negative and his mental status was thought to be due to over medication. One the day of admission patient had been out on a day pass and returned poorly responsive. On return he was noted to be drooling and disoriented. His pupils were sluggish and his O[NUM] sat was [NUM]%. He woke up with narcan.

Rads: [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] Non-contrast head CT: FINDINGS: No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified. There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles are normal in size and symmetric, and the basal cisterns are well visualized. The density of the brain parenchyma appears unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate marked mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus, unchanged. The mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits appear unremarkable. The surrounding soft tissue structures do not demonstrate any abnormalities. IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic mucosal changes in the left maxillary sinus. [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] CXR: FINDINGS: There is an ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe partially obscuring the right diaphragm that likely represents small amount of atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. The left costophrenic angle was not imaged and thus a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in projection. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe atelectasis [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] ECG: Baseline artifact Sinus tachycardia. Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes are suggested but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult. Since previous tracing of [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**], sinus tachycardia and slight ST-T wave changes present [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] CXR: Lung volumes are low with several bibasilar areas of atelectasis. The heart size is normal. The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: Bilateral bibasilar atelectasis with no overt evidence of pneumonia. Brief Hospital Course: [NUM]) Altered mental status, Narcotic overdose: Tox screen negative for everything except opiates. Patient was initially poorly responsive, but came around with Narcan. Admited to ICU for close monitoring. After first [NUM]hours in the hospital, he became more interactive and stated that while out on his day pass from the [**Hospital[NUM] [NUM]**] House he took what he thought were Tylenol that a friend gave him. He also stated that on occassion he takes Percocet for R knee pain, unclear if this is prescribed for him and if so which MD prescribes it. He denied taking it on the day of his admit. In the [**Hospital Unit Name [NUM]**], his mental status remained stable after his first [NUM] hours. Though he denied SI on admit, he does have a strong h/o SI and later during course noted that he was hearing voices telling him to hurt himself. He had insight that this was from his pscyh illness. [NUM]) Aspiration pneumonitis: Patient received levofloxacin and flagyl in the [**Doctor First Name [NUM]**] for presumed asp pneumonia, though abx were stopped once he arrived in the [**Hospital Unit Name [NUM]**] as it was felt that he was stable and likely had a chemical pneumonitis from aspiration rather than pna. His WBC trended down, he remained afebrile, and his respiratory status improved. [NUM]) Substance abuse: substance abuse counsellor consulted. Avoided narcotics or sedating meds while in house. [NUM]) Schizoaffective disorder: restarted psychiatric medications once he was awake enough to eat, except for Neurontin, Benadryl and Remeron at the advice of the [**Hospital Unit Name **] team in house. As noted above, he continued to have AH regarding hurting himself and per [**Hospital Unit Name **] was kept on a [NUM]:[NUM] sitter, despite his statements that he was not going to hurt himself. Will need further management of his condition in a monitored locked unit after discharge from medical care. [NUM]) Elevated blood glucose: his daily fasting AM blood glucose values ranged [NUM]-[NUM], with no values over [NUM]. Started [**Doctor First Name **] diet. Should have outpt GTT to eval for impaired glucose tolerance. Will benefit from weight loss regimen. [NUM]) Prophylaxis: heparin SC, PPI . Folate, Thiamine, MVI.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care Facility: [**Hospital [NUM]**] Hospital - [**Location (un) [NUM]**] Discharge Diagnosis: altered mental status, likely from opiod overdose suicidal ideation schizoaffective disorder Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, with no further evidence of intoxication. Heard voices on the AM of discharge telling him to hurt himself, though he has insight that this is related to his schizoaffective disorder and is cooperative with his treatment plan. Denies a desire to hurt himself currently. Discharge Instructions: Please continue to take your medications as prescribed and to cooperate with your healthcare team. Also, if you hear any voices of people who are not present around you, or if you feel like hurting yourself or someone else around you, please let your caretakers know immediately.

The left anterior descending artery was occluded proximally with fresh thrombus.  The left circumflex had mild luminal irregularities.  There was a medium-sized ramus intermedius with a 90% proximal lesion.  The right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with 50% proximal stenosis and then was occluded at the midportion.  The distal right coronary artery was reconstituted with right-to-right collaterals with TIMI 1 flow.  There was successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the proximal to mid left anterior descending coronary artery, as well as thrombectomy with a final result of TIMI 3 flow.  Right heart catheterization was done as well showing elevated pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32, a mean right atrial pressure of 22 mmHg.  PA pressure was 56/25.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is an [NUM]-year-old woman without significant past medical history whose only cardiac risk factor was her age. She was transferred from [**Hospital [NUM]**] where she presented the morning of admission with chest pain radiating to her jaw. At [**Hospital [NUM]**] she was found to have ST elevations anteriorly and inferiorly. She was started on aspirin, give a beta blocker and started on a heparin drip and transferred immediately to [**Hospital [NUM]**] for cardiac catheterization. In retrospect the patient recalls experiencing chest tightness with exertion for approximately two weeks prior to admission, as well as chest tightness over the two days prior to admission even at times of rest. She denies any other complaints. The patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory upon arrival before coming to the coronary care unit. There she was found to have a right dominant system with two-vessel coronary artery disease. The left main coronary artery had a [NUM]% ostial lesion. The left anterior descending artery was occluded proximally with fresh thrombus. The left circumflex had mild luminal irregularities. There was a medium-sized ramus intermedius with a [NUM]% proximal lesion. The right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with [NUM]% proximal stenosis and then was occluded at the midportion. The distal right coronary artery was reconstituted with right-to-right collaterals with TIMI [NUM] flow. There was successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the proximal to mid left anterior descending coronary artery, as well as thrombectomy with a final result of TIMI [NUM] flow. Right heart catheterization was done as well showing elevated pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of [NUM], a mean right atrial pressure of [NUM] mmHg. PA pressure was [NUM]/[NUM]. The cardiac index was depressed at [NUM].[NUM]. Following catheterization the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit for further monitoring. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Anxiety. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Buspar and Remeron. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: No history of coronary artery disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies use of tobacco or alcohol. She lives in [**Location [NUM]**] independently. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission to the coronary care unit the patient was afebrile, heart rate was [NUM], blood pressure [NUM]/[NUM], oxygen saturation was [NUM]% on four liters, respiratory rate [NUM]. PA pressure at that time was [NUM]/[NUM]. Pertinent physical findings reveal that her sclerae were anicteric. Her oropharynx was clear and dry. Examination of the neck revealed jugular venous distension to the earlobes bilaterally. Her lungs had crackles at the left base but were otherwise clear. Her abdomen was obese, soft and nontender. Her heart examination revealed a normal S[NUM] and S[NUM], no murmurs were heard. Extremity examination revealed decreased distal pulses bilaterally, no edema, and the patient had significant hematoma at the right groin. The patient had had an Angio-Seal placed which temporarily became unseated after the case as the patient was a bit agitated. The hematoma was stable after compression held in the catheterization laboratory and was not found to be enlarging on examination. LABORATORY STUDIES: Chem-[NUM] was unremarkable. Initial set of cardiac enzymes revealed a CK of [NUM] with an MB fraction of [NUM]. Troponin was [NUM].[NUM]. HOSPITAL COURSE: [NUM]. Cardiovascular: A. Coronary artery disease: The patient was status post anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction. She was continued on aspirin after the procedure as well as Integrilin for [NUM] hours post catheterization. She was started on Plavix to be continued for [NUM] days. Immediately post catheterization because of her depressed cardiac output and index, her beta blocker and ACE inhibitors were held. Eventually as her hemodynamics improved and her blood pressure tolerated, she was restarted on beta blocker, initially Lopressor [NUM].[NUM] mg b.i.d. The patient was called out of the coronary care unit to the medical floor on the next hospital day, [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] after the Swan-Ganz catheter had been discontinued. Her lipid panel was checked showing that she had an LDL of [NUM] and HDL of [NUM]. With these numbers the patient was not started on a statin. Her beta blocker was titrated to [NUM] mg b.i.d. and was well tolerated. B. Rhythm: The patient was in sinus rhythm throughout her hospitalization. On hospital day number to she was found to have an [NUM]-beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Electrophysiology was consulted regarding risk stratification in this woman peri-MI.

G tube placement in [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**]. [NUM]. Excision of thigh lipoma in [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**]. [NUM]. Left cataract extraction with lens implant. ALLERGIES: Keflex which causes a rash, Reglan which causes dystonia, and acetazolamide. ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: [NUM]. Protonix [NUM] b.i.d. [NUM]. Theophylline [NUM] q.p.m. [NUM]. Multivitamin. [NUM]. Milk of magnesia. [NUM]. Loratadine [NUM] mg every evening. [NUM]. Lactobacillus [NUM] b.i.d. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a resident of [**Location [NUM]**] Developmental Center. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, nontender with a G tube in place. Extremities: Severe muscular atrophy, no edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to preop and holding where he underwent narrow-field laryngectomy. The patient tolerated this procedure well. Please see the operative note for details. Chest x-ray postoperatively revealed a tracheostomy tube in good position with no pneumothorax. The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on the ventilator. He was placed on IV Clindamycin and IV Flagyl. On postoperative day number one, it was attempted to wean the patient off the ventilator. The patient was weaned to CPAP; however, he was placed back on the ventilator due to desaturations. Pink frothy sputum was noted at the site of the tracheostomy. Chest x-ray showed a small amount of CHF; however, the patient's lungs were clear to auscultation and it was again attempted to wean the ventilator. Tube feeds were also started on postoperative day number two at [NUM] cc per hour and tube feeds were advanced conservatively to a goal of [NUM] cc per hour. The patient was weaned from the ventilator on postoperative day number three successfully. The patient was transferred from the ICU to a floor bed on postoperative day number five. His tracheostomy tube was removed and [**Initials (NamePattern[NUM]) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern[NUM]) [NUM]**]-Singer tracheostomy tube was put in its place to support the stoma until it had matured. Duoderm was placed in the parastomal area to protect skin from breakdown. The patient was placed in a continuous [NUM] sat monitor setting. He was kept n.p.o. and tube feeds were advanced to goal. On postoperative day number seven, it was attempted to obtain a Barium swallow study to test for any esophageal leak; however, per the Radiology staff, the patient was unable to cooperate with the Barium swallow in that he was unable to maintain proper positioning during the study and was unable to follow commands as to when to swallow the barium contrast. However, the patient was felt to be stable and was discharged on postoperative day number seven. Throughout his hospital stay, his electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed. Nutrition was consulted for advice regarding the patient's tube feeds and he remained stable throughout his hospital stay. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

Her history patient is a resident at [**Hospital [NUM]**] who was found status post questionable fall the morning of admission and was noted to have a left-sided weakness without head trauma or loss of consciousness. The fall was unwitnessed. Subsequently the patient had a large occult blood positive stool and was also found to have complaints of abdominal pain. At the nursing home the temperature was [NUM].[NUM] with a pulse of [NUM], blood in by ambulance to [**Hospital [NUM]**] Emergency Department for evaluation with a temperature of [NUM].[NUM], pulse [NUM], blood pressure [NUM]/[NUM] and respiratory rate of [NUM] with an oxygen saturation of [NUM]%. In the Emergency Department the patient was found to have an increased respiratory rate. She denied cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting or dysuria. She did complain of abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient is demented at baseline. The patient denied any fevers or chills prior though it is unclear but it is possibly p.o. intake had been decreased for several days. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, status post congestive heart failure with last admission in [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] for diastolic heart failure, Type [NUM] diabetes, dementia, benign positional vertigo, status post cholecystectomy, status post femoral neck fracture on the right with a hemiarthroplasty, chronic anemia with hematocrit of [NUM] and B[NUM] deficiency. ALLERGIES: Benzodiazepine which causes severe agitation. ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: [NUM]. Multivitamin [NUM]. Enteric coated Aspirin [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. [NUM]. Lasix [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. [NUM]. Prinivil [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. [NUM]. Megace [NUM] mg p.o. b.i.d. [NUM]. Lopressor [NUM] mg p.o. b.i.d. [NUM]. Isordil [NUM] mg p.o. t.i.d. [NUM]. Neurontin [NUM] mg p.o. q. [NUM] [NUM]. Colace [NUM] mg p.o. b.i.d. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination revealed a temperature of [NUM].[NUM], pulse [NUM], blood pressure [NUM]/[NUM] and respiratory rate of [NUM] and oxygen saturation of [NUM]%. The patient was an awake, alert, tachypneic elderly white female in mild distress. Pupils were left, surgical, minimally reactive, right reactive. Extraocular muscles grossly intact. Oropharynx, mucous membranes were dry, edentulous. Neck was supple with jugulovenous distension of [NUM] cm, no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination, tachycardiac, normal S[NUM] and S[NUM]. Lungs with decreased breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly at the bases, otherwise clear to auscultation. Abdomen was diffusely tender with bowel sounds, no masses, no organomegaly and mild distention. Occult blood positive brown stool per the Emergency Department. Back examination, positive costovertebral angle tenderness bilaterally per Emergency Department. Extremities with [NUM]+ pitting bilaterally with no edema. Left hip with [NUM] cm erythematous abrasion, no pelvic instability, no pain to passive range of motion of the left hip. No abrasions on the upper extremity. Neurological examination, per the Emergency Department, alert answering questions in [**Ethnicity [NUM]**]. Cranial nerves III through XII grossly intact. Left arm, flaccid, no response to pain. Left leg withdraws to pain but also flaccid. LABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count [NUM].[NUM], hemoglobin [NUM].[NUM], hematocrit [NUM].[NUM], platelets [NUM],[NUM]. PT was [NUM].[NUM], PTT [NUM].[NUM], INR [NUM].[NUM]. [NUM] white blood cells on urinalysis. Glucose was [NUM], BUN [NUM], creatinine [NUM].[NUM], sodium [NUM], potassium [NUM].[NUM], chloride [NUM], bicarbonate [NUM], ALT [NUM], AST [NUM], CK [NUM],[NUM], alkaline phosphatase [NUM], total bilirubin [NUM].[NUM], CK MB [NUM]. Albumin [NUM].[NUM], calcium [NUM].[NUM], phosphorus [NUM].[NUM], magnesium [NUM].[NUM]. Cardiac troponin greater than [NUM]. Base x-ray on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] revealed a right lower lobe opacity with atelectasis and probable pneumonia. Computerized tomography scan on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] revealed a small right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis right greater than left with dense vascular calcification. There was a large hiatal hernia, nonspecific large bowel wall thickening without stranding or pneumatosis which could not exclude bowel ischemia, probable sacral myelocele was there as well. Computerized tomography scan of the cervical spine on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] revealed degenerative joint disease without evidence of acute fracture. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit. Given her high troponin levels, Cardiology was seen in consultation and they felt that it was not appropriate to cardiac catheterize the patient at that time. Given her history of large bloody stool, the patient was not deemed a candidate for heparinization either. She was maintained on Aspirin, Beta blocker and as lytes improved an ACE inhibitor was added as well. During her course in the hospital the patient did continue to have transient chest pain which was often relieved by Nitroglycerin but no electrocardiogram changes were found. Some episodes of chest pain did have to be treated with [NUM] mg of intravenous morphine. The patient was placed on Nitropaste to provide longterm pain relief and the patient's episodes of chest pain subsided. Infectious Disease - The patient was seen to have probable sepsis with several possible etiologies including the possibility of ischemic bowel as indicated by the computerized tomography scan as above, infectious colitis and urosepsis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and a Surgery consultation was obtained. The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] for an exploratory laparotomy to rule out ischemic bowel and it was ruled out by this procedure. Please see the operative note dictation for further details of this procedure. To continue the workup of her diarrhea, the patient received stool cultures which were all negative and Clostridium difficile cultures which were negative times three. The patient's diarrhea continued and ultimately it was felt that possibly the diarrhea was caused by her antibiotics. After an acceptable course of antibiotic therapy for her urosepsis and pneumonia these were discontinued and the diarrhea did resolve. The patient did receive a transfusion of [NUM] units of packed red blood cells over her stay in the hospital due to a low hematocrit and her history of coronary artery disease and recent myocardial infarction. Renal - The patient did have acid based abnormalities with a respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis likely lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis with an anion gap. There was no evidence of ketones. Electrolytes and bicarbonate were administered to adjust the patient's electrolyte status. The patient's renal failure was attributed to prerenal azotemia and she was hydrated to relieve this. Electrolyte adjustment continued throughout her stay in the Medicine Intensive Care Unit as well as her stay on the floor. Neurologic - The patient was considered as possibly having had a cerebrovascular accident. Computerized tomography scan in the Emergency Department was negative for any new ischemia. It was felt that sepsis and/or ischemia may be unmasking left-sided weakness. The patient was followed with a repeat computerized tomography scan and was seen by the Neurology Consult Service. The patient's weakness did resolve. No further workup ensued at this point. Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with bloody diarrhea as described above. The workup above was undertaken and in addition further computerized tomography scans were obtained after the patient was transferred from the Medicine Intensive Care Unit to the General Medical Floor because of ongoing diarrhea. One of these abdominal computerized tomography scans revealed a small well circumscribed lesion in the pancreas. The patient's lipase was elevated. The question was raised as to whether or not the patient may be experiencing pancreatitis and the patient was maintained on a BRAT diet, lipase levels declined. It was felt that this may be contributing to the patient's abdominal complaint. An abdominal ultrasound on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] revealed no additional changes in this lesion. Eventually the patient's diarrhea declined. Genitourinary - One of the aforementioned computerized tomography scans also revealed a fluid-filled uterus. To workup this discovery a transvaginal ultrasound was undertaken which revealed a uterine stripe of [NUM].[NUM] cm. This was reviewed with the Gynecology Consult Service and they recommended the patient have an outpatient uterine biopsy. They felt that there were no urgency to working up this problem at this time. With respect to the above issues, the patient's status gradually improved. CKs continued to trend down. Lipase trended down. Electrolytes improved. Diarrhea subsided. The patient was also seen by the Speech and Swallow Service who felt that the patient could tolerate ground food given her swallowing problems. The patient also developed a urinary tract infection with yeast. This was treated with Diflucan. On [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**], the patient was deemed stable for discharge back to the [**Hospital [NUM]**] Nursing Home. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient should continue a ground diet with thick liquids to resume physical therapy as tolerated. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: [NUM]. Aspirin [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. [NUM].

The patient reports that she was feeling in her USH up until Sunday ([**12-27**]) when she experienced fever, abdominal pain, nausea and emesis. The pt continued to feel poorly and went to the [**Doctor First Name 3**] on Monday ([**12-28**]), where she was found to be febrile up to 104 RR 24 and tachycardic HR 137. WBC with 10 K wbc and 11 % bands. She had an abnormal UA c 5 wbc . CxR was nl. The pt was admitted for IV antibiotics/ and hydration to treat possible pneumonia/UTI .She was given Ceftriaxone and LEvofloxacin.  Patient remained persistently febrile and on [**12-29**] her respiratory status worsened. She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 221**] for monitoring. Never intubated. Blood cultures from [**12-28**] turned positive for Group A strep, and the patient was started on Ceftriaxone/ Clinda/ and PCN G. Urine culture with gropu B streptococcus. Non contrast abdominal CT revealed markedly enlarged R kidney w/ numerous adipose tissue densities, no air fluid levels/ gas present, enlarged spleen. ID consult was obtained, and the etiology of strep A was undetermined. It was recommended that she be started on IV Ig and possibly APC, and an MRI be obtained to further characterize renal lesion.  \n",

Appearance, emaciated elderly lying uncomfortably on his right side, unwilling to cooperate full, disinterested, was fed and irritated. The patient has severe cervical rigidity and kyphosis. Range of motion of the neck is severely decreased. The neck is nontender to palpation. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Normal S[NUM], S[NUM]. Abdomen: Soft, tender, no organomegaly, +[NUM] brachial pulses bilaterally. Neurologic exam: He is awake, alert, oriented to all modalities except he believes that it is [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]. Aware of all the recent current events. Speech fluent, spontaneous, no paraphasic errors. There is no right-left confusion, neglect. Release testing reveals left greater that right palmomental reflex, normal jaw jerk, no rooting, slight grasp bilaterally. On cranial nerve exam: Ocular discs are sharp. Visual fields full, [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] round and reactive. There is no relative afferent defect. Extraocular movements are full, no nystagmus. Facial sensation intact to light touch. Face is symmetric and movements are intact. Sternocleidomastoid strength of [NUM]/[NUM]. Tongue movements are intact and palatal elevation is symmetric. On motor exam, there is generally decreased bulk and tone, decreased symmetrically, there is generalized wasting, especially of the intrinsic muscles of the hands, quads, gastrocnemius bilaterally. No drift. Motor strength testing reveals generally [NUM]+/[NUM] in the upper extremities and anywhere from [NUM]-[NUM] in the lower extremities. He was able to exert some proximal movements, but no distal. Reflexes are brachial [NUM]+ bilaterally and [NUM]+ bilaterally otherwise with downgoing toes bilaterally and no clonus. On sensory exam, light touch is decreased in the feet bilaterally. It is difficult to determine whether or not there is a sensory level. Repeated testing does not show any clear finding. Pinprick and temperature is decreased in the feet symmetrically. Position sense was impaired in the toes, but not impaired in the ankles. Mildly impaired position sense in the fingers bilaterally. Coordination testing, finger to nose is without ataxia. Stance and gait could not be tested. LABORATORY DATA: Electrocardiogram [NUM]: Atrial fibrillation, nonspecific ST changes. Laboratories from [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]: CBC: White blood cell count [NUM].[NUM], hematocrit [NUM] and CB [NUM], platelets [NUM]. INR [NUM].[NUM], CK [NUM]. HOSPITAL COURSE: As noted above, [NUM]-year-old man admitted initially to the Neurology Service on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**], ultimately transferred to the Medical Service on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**]. He was admitted with severe paraparesis, status post fall without loss of consciousness or head trauma and worsening back pain. CT of the thoracolumbar spine done on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] showed T[NUM], L[NUM], L[NUM]-L[NUM] compression fractures with retrolisthesis of L[NUM] and L[NUM] and L[NUM] on L[NUM] and a calcified mass on the tail of the pancreas. CT of abdomen [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] with contrast showed a [NUM] x [NUM] x [NUM]. cm mass in the tail of the pancreas and several tiny nodules in lung bases, left greater with right with patchy linear opacities in right base. Bone scan on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] showed increased foci in the lower lumbar spine and right iliac ring suspicious for metastatic disease. MRI of lumbar spine showed mass in the lumbo-sacral region. A myelogram was ordered initially, but could not be done because the patient refused the myelogram on the first day and subsequently had abnormally high INR. On the day that the myelogram was scheduled for, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after a respiratory arrest on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] and intubated. Bronchoscopy at that time showed significant aspirated material. Differential diagnoses include: Secondary to his narcotic pain medications versus aspiration pneumonia. His pCO[NUM] at that time was noted to be [NUM]. He was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin and Counseling service while he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He was initially started on dexamethasone for presumed cord compression on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] and family ultimately declined transfer to [**Hospital [NUM]**] for CT myelogram. It should be noted that the patient was unable to tolerate an MRI secondary to his scoliosis. Transiently on dopamine for hypotension and transfused one unit of packed red blood cells. Ultimately, patient did receive a CT myelogram which showed obstruction to flow of contrast from below at T[NUM] and T[NUM] level. It was an overall limited study. Also a sacral mass at the epidural extension. Question of a T spine epidural mass and ultimately his Decadron was discontinued on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**], because of no improvement. He received Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology consults. The patient was extubated on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**] with a plan for a sacral mass biopsy. CT guided biopsy which was done on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**]. Patient was transiently transferred to the Medical Service from [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] through [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] but had another respiratory arrest while on the floor with gradually worsening hypercapnia and acidosis. He was found unresponsive, without respirations and reintubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Overall impression at this time on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] was that patient likely had metastatic pancreatic disease, left pancreatic cancer. He had a mildly elevated PSA but this was not thought to be related to his current process. Ultimately, his biopsy of his sacral lesions was consistent with malignancy, likely adenocarcinoma. Respiratory support was continued with suspected patient more than likely had a mucus plugging event. In discussion between the family, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) [NUM]**], patient's primary care physician, [**Name[NUM] (NameIs) **] the Team, it was felt that the patient clearly had another source of adenocarcinoma. His overall prognosis is extremely grave and the patient's dopamine was weaned. The patient was extubated and accepted by Deacon Hospice and was transferred there on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**]. Patient had requested that his body be donated as an anatomic gift to [**Hospital [NUM]**] Medical School. Family was given the number to contact. CONDITION OF DISCHARGE: Grave. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Same as presenting medical history with addition of metastatic adenocarcinoma. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Not known to this dictator at this time though medical care was guided as to focused on comfort care and hospice care.

Heparin was started and he was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2014-07-15**],  Mr. [**lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with an aortic valve replacement utilizing a 23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) **] mechanical valve. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7875**] neurologically intact and was extubated. He was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for his mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation. Mr. [**lastname **] had pain with swallowing and his medications were changed to elixirs. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. The otolaryngology service was consulted who noted a mucosal irregularity on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Saline gargles were recommended and bactroban nasal ointment for epistaxis prophylaxis. Follow-up was recommended in 3 weeks to assess resolution of the lesion. Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] sore throat slowly improved so that he was able to adequately take in sufficient nutrition. As his INR was subtherapeutic, heparin was started until his INR was within range. Ultimately, his INR rose above 2.0 and his heparin was discontinued. Mr. [**lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day ten. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 457**], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.\n",

She also had a cholesterol panel during her hospitalization with a total cholesterol of [NUM], triglycerides were [NUM], high-density lipoprotein was [NUM], and low-density lipoprotein was [NUM]. Hemoglobin A[NUM]c was [NUM].[NUM]. RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: The patient's electrocardiogram on hospital day two demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm at [NUM] with atrioventricular conduction delay. New T wave inversions in leads I, aVL, V[NUM] through V[NUM]. Q waves in leads in III and aVF. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent arteriovenous fistula repair and thrombectomy on hospital day one without complications. However, on postoperative day one, the patient developed the acute onset of substernal chest pain with diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. An electrocardiogram demonstrated new T wave inversions in the anterolateral leads, and the patient was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization revealed [NUM]-vessel disease with [NUM]% proximal and [NUM]% mid left anterior descending artery stenosis, [NUM]% proximal left circumflex stenosis, [NUM]% second obtuse marginal stenosis, and [NUM]% proximal and [NUM]% mid right coronary artery stenosis. The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting (times two) of the left anterior descending artery with good results. The patient had a stable post catheterization course until [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]; when, during hemodialysis, the patient complained of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. Hemodialysis was discontinued early, and the patient was returned to the floor where the nausea and vomiting continued, and the patient complained of recurrent chest pain. A repeat electrocardiogram demonstrated anteroinferior ST elevations, and the patient went for emergent re-look catheterization. Catheterization was without evidence of acute thrombosis or change in anatomy, and no intervention was required. However, immediately status post catheterization, the patient developed large hematemesis; initially coffee-grounds emesis followed by bright red blood per rectum. The patient was hemodynamically stable and without chest pain at the time and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for further management. The patient's blood pressure medications were held, and the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of [NUM].[NUM] (down from [NUM] twelve hours prior). The patient refused a nasogastric lavage and was started on high-dose proton pump inhibitor without further episodes of hematemesis. The patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable without further episodes of chest pain. An echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated mild left and right atrial dilatation, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal right and left ventricular size and function, with an ejection fraction of [NUM]%, moderate aortic root dilatation, and [NUM]+ aortic regurgitation, and trivial tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Medicine floor where he remained for [NUM] hours. The patient's hematocrit remained stable with a discharge hematocrit of [NUM].[NUM]. There was no further need for a transfusion. The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and blood pressure medications were restarted without complications. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis three times per week). The patient was continued on hemodialysis throughout the hospitalization via a temporary port while the arteriovenous fistula matured. The arteriovenous fistula remained dressed and without signs of infection. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Condition on discharge was good; ambulating without difficulty, chest pain free, and without further evidence of bleeding. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: [NUM]. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. [NUM]. Status post cardiac catheterization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending artery. [NUM]. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (no intervention). [NUM]. Status post arteriovenous fistula repair and thrombectomy. [NUM]. End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis). [NUM]. Cerebrovascular accident with residual left hemiparesis. [NUM]. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [NUM]. Gout. [NUM]. Diverticulosis. [NUM]. Multiple Escherichia coli bacteremia infections. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: [NUM]. Plavix [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. (times three months). [NUM]. Enalapril [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. [NUM]. Labetalol [NUM] mg p.o. q.d. [NUM]. Protonix [NUM] mg p.o. b.i.d. [NUM]. Isosorbide dinitrate [NUM] mg p.o. t.i.d. [NUM]. Sevelamer hydrochloride [NUM] mg p.o. t.i.d. [NUM]. Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.d. [NUM]. Sublingual nitroglycerin [NUM].[NUM] mg tablet as needed (for chest pain). [NUM]. Clonidine patch TTS #[NUM] every week. DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged to home with Visiting Nurse Association services for medication teaching and compliance reinforcement. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP: [NUM]. The patient was instructed to continue hemodialysis as per usual on the day status post discharge. [NUM]. An appointment with Vascular/Transplant Surgery; follow up with Dr. [**First Name[NUM] (NamePattern[NUM]) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern[NUM]) [NUM]**] on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] at [NUM] p.m. at [**Street Address [NUM]**].

Her outpatient medications including labetalol, Enalapril, and Norvasc were reinitiated given her recent noncompliance with these medications. Additionally, a Catapres patch was placed on the patient. Given her fluid overload secondary to dialysis noncompliance, plans were made to initiate hemodialysis after appropriate access was placed. The patient was maintained on Nipride drip upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and throughout her three to four day hospital course was placed back on her outpatient regimen with the Nipride drip being weaned off during her second day of Medical Intensive Care Unit stay. End stage renal disease. Interventional Radiology was consulted from the emergency department to establish access for hemodialysis. The patient initially refused such intervention, but ultimately consented to such on the evening of admission. The renal consult team was asked to see the patient in the emergency department and managed her end-stage renal disease throughout her hospital course, receiving several rounds of hemodialysis prior to discharge. The patient's outpatient nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) [NUM]**], evaluated the patient on a daily basis in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and contributed to her care. Psychiatry. The patient expressed suicidal ideations and all her statements that indicated her noncompliance with medications and hemodialysis were secondary to her depression. The psychiatry consult team evaluated the patient in the emergency department and consulted during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay and deemed her competent to make decisions regarding her own care and not an acute risk to herself or others. Neurology. Given the above-mentioned CT findings, the Neurology Stroke Consult Service was consulted and felt that the findings seen on CT were consistent with small-vessel disease resulting in a lacunar infarct. Given the patient's nonfocal neurology exam, recommendations were made to control the patient's blood pressure adequately and start the patient on one daily aspirin. Further lifestyle modifications, specifically that regarding recreational drug abuse and tobacco use were recommended as well as testing a baseline lipid panel, which was pending at the time of discharge. Lymphadenopathy. During her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was noted to have a tender left submandibular lymph node approximately [NUM] cm to [NUM] cm in size without evidence of pharyngitis or other oropharyngeal lesions. In light of this, an HIV test was sent and was pending at the time of discharge; and the patient was instructed to followup with her primary care physician regarding the persistence of such a lesion. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: To home. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: End-stage renal disease. Hypertension. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: [NUM]. Enalapril [NUM] mg [NUM] tablets p.o. q.d. [NUM].

An EGD revealed an actively bleeding gastric ulcer and nonbleeding esophageal varices. Initial Hct was found to be 28.8 and platelets were found to be 37,000. Pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u FFP, 5u Plts. Pt was intubated for airway protection and started on octreotide, protonix, levofloxacin, flagyl and ativan. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 33**] for further treatment.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 33**], pt's vital signs were stable. A repeat EGD was performed, which showed  non-bleeding grade III esophageal varices in the lower [**01-28**] of the esophagus. In addition, there were extensive ulcerations in both esophagus and stomach. The stomach was found to be diffusely erythematous, congested and nodular with evidence of severe gastropathy. There were a few dark clots with no active bleeding. In the greater curvature, there was heaped up mucosa, likely the area of recent hemorrhage. The nature of the lesion, (a gastric varix versus focal bleed of gastropathy versus bleeding ulcer) was unable to be determined. No intervention was performed. In the [**Hospital Unit Name **], pt was stable. He has not required any further blood products. Hct has been stable, fluctuating within a range of  30.5-33.8. He passed 2 more melenic stools in the [**Hospital Unit Name **]. Pt was extubated on [**01-27**] and tolerated a wean of supplemental O2. A RUQ U/S was obtained, which showed a small amount of ascites. The liver was nodular and superior mesenteric, portal and splenic veins and hepatic arteries and veins were patent. Pt was transferred to the floor on [**01-29**]. His vital signs remained stable. His Hct remained stable at 30-34 with no further episodes of hemetemesis or melena. Pt will obtain a repeat EGD as well as a colonoscopy as an outpatient. He will follow up the Liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3974**]) on Tuesday [**02-04**], to have a repeat EGD. Given the pt's history of chronic EtoH abuse, DT prophylaxis with diazepam was continued, following a CIWA scale.  On [**01-28**] and [**01-29**] the patient had 2 episodes of asymptomatic NSVT.  Mg and K were repleted as they were low normal. An Echo was performed which revealed preserved biventricular function. He continued to have low normal potassium and magnesium which was aggressively repleted. His electrolyte loss was attributed to his alcoholic liver disease.  The pt was also found to be pancytopenic which platelet counts in the 40s to 60s and mild leukopenia ranging aroun 3700. \n",
            "Platelet counts and leukocytes remained stable.  \n",

He was transfused [NUM]u PRBC, [NUM]u FFP, and [NUM]u Plts at the OSH and intubated for airway protection. EGD there demonstrated non-bleeding varices and a bleeding gastric ulcer (unable to successfully cauterize/epi inject). He was transfered here for further care. On transfer, the patient was hemodynamically stable in the ER and was started on octreotide, nadolol, protonix, and levaquin. He received a repeat EGD which showed grade III non-bleeding varices in the lower [NUM]rd of the esophagus along with extensive esophageal ulceration. In the stomach, they noted severe gastropathy along with a non-bleeding proximal stomach lesion. He was maintained on a CIWA scale throughout his stay. He has not received blood products since admission. The patient was extubated on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**], tolerated this well, and was weaned off supplemental O[NUM] by the time he was called out to the floor. Today, the patient complains of intermittant diffuse abdominal pain that is relieved with passing gas/bowel movements. He also notes intermittant L sided CP that has happened on and off for the past several months only while he is active. He denies radiation or associated symptoms and states that it is happening ~ [NUM]x/d and abates after approximately [NUM]min. He denies any CP currently and also denies current abdominal pain, SOB, HA, weakness, palpatations, paresthesias. Past Medical History: [NUM].

Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Small amounts of older clotted blood was seen in the body and fundus, but no active bleeding was seen. Extensive ulceration of the mid-distal esophagus. Severe erythema, congestion and nodularity in the stomach body and fundus compatible with severe portal gastrophathy. Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum Brief Hospital Course: Pt presented to OSH, with hemetemesis and melena. There, his BP was [NUM]/[NUM] and HR was [NUM]. An NGT was placed. Aspirate revealed [NUM]cc of red blood. An EGD revealed an actively bleeding gastric ulcer and nonbleeding esophageal varices. Initial Hct was found to be [NUM].[NUM] and platelets were found to be [NUM],[NUM]. Pt was transfused [NUM]u PRBC, [NUM]u FFP, [NUM]u Plts. Pt was intubated for airway protection and started on octreotide, protonix, levofloxacin, flagyl and ativan. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital[NUM] [NUM]**] for further treatment. On transfer to [**Hospital[NUM] [NUM]**], pt's vital signs were stable. A repeat EGD was performed, which showed non-bleeding grade III esophageal varices in the lower [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] of the esophagus. In addition, there were extensive ulcerations in both esophagus and stomach. The stomach was found to be diffusely erythematous, congested and nodular with evidence of severe gastropathy. There were a few dark clots with no active bleeding. In the greater curvature, there was heaped up mucosa, likely the area of recent hemorrhage. The nature of the lesion, (a gastric varix versus focal bleed of gastropathy versus bleeding ulcer) was unable to be determined. No intervention was performed. In the [**Hospital Unit Name **], pt was stable. He has not required any further blood products. Hct has been stable, fluctuating within a range of [NUM].[NUM]-[NUM].[NUM]. He passed [NUM] more melenic stools in the [**Hospital Unit Name **]. Pt was extubated on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] and tolerated a wean of supplemental O[NUM]. A RUQ U/S was obtained, which showed a small amount of ascites. The liver was nodular and superior mesenteric, portal and splenic veins and hepatic arteries and veins were patent. Pt was transferred to the floor on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]. His vital signs remained stable. His Hct remained stable at [NUM]-[NUM] with no further episodes of hemetemesis or melena. Pt will obtain a repeat EGD as well as a colonoscopy as an outpatient. He will follow up the Liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) [NUM]**]) on Tuesday [**[NUM]-[NUM]**], to have a repeat EGD. Given the pt's history of chronic EtoH abuse, DT prophylaxis with diazepam was continued, following a CIWA scale. On [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] and [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] the patient had [NUM] episodes of asymptomatic NSVT. Mg and K were repleted as they were low normal. An Echo was performed which revealed preserved biventricular function. He continued to have low normal potassium and magnesium which was aggressively repleted. His electrolyte loss was attributed to his alcoholic liver disease. The pt was also found to be pancytopenic which platelet counts in the [NUM]s to [NUM]s and mild leukopenia ranging aroun [NUM]. Platelet counts and leukocytes remained stable. Pt met with social worker to discuss outpatient addiction services. After contacting several programs, the patient decided to attend a daily group program with his son. His family is supportive of this decision.

            "She was initially stable after transfer but after 2-3 hours decompensated and was taken to the cath lab. She was found to have patent stents, but she continued to deteriorate. She was placed on ECMO, and then was taken to the OR with vascular surgery for repair of her Left CFA, CFV, and EIA at the site of the previous IABP.  TEE showed Ebsteins anomaly with markedly dilated RA/RV with focal RV hypokinesis, severe TR, small LV with focal inferior hypokinesis with EF > 60%, trace MR, no AI. On [**11-23**] she was taken to the operating room where she underwent placement of and RVAD and removal of ECMO. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 8**] on epinephrine, milrinone, levophed and propofol as well as Nitric oxide. She developed fevers for which she was cultured and ID was consulted. Cultures remained negative, she was placed on broad antibiotic coverage. She remained intubated and paralyzed, with likely ARDS. She was seen by hematology for difficulty maintaining a therapeutic ptt and thrombocytopenia. She was HIT -, and the thrombocytopenia was thought to be secondary to the VAD as well as illness. She was started on tube feeds. Vascular continued to follow her for her groin incisions, which eventually required VAC dressing. Her sternal wound developed purulent draiange, and the wound was opened and a vac dressing was applied there as well. She remained on vanco, zosyn and flagyl. CT scan of head/chest abdomen/pelvis on [**12-02**] was essentially negative for infection with the exception of a 7.3 cm right groin fluid collection. There as no bleed or infarct on head CT. She was seen by optho for conjunctivitis and placed on erythromycin ointment.  She continued to have fever and white count, but negative cultures. TEE on [**12-04**] showed no eveidence of endocarditis. Her respiratory status improved and her sedation was weaned. CXR showed slow resolution of ARDS. Her zosyn was changed to meropenum given the continued fevers, as well as fluconazole for some yeast growth from her wounds. She remained febrile despite antibiotic change, however her white count began to improve.  She was taken to the cath lab on [**12-16**] for placement of a PA cath in preparation for RVAD weaning.   Fevers continued, she remained on vanco, fluc, and ceftaz was started on [**12-17**].  On [**12-17**] she was found to have melena  and HCT drop, and GI was consulted. Gastric lavage showed maroon/black but no fresh blood. She was started on a protonix drip. EGD showed blood in the stomach, and findings consistent with hemorrhagic gastritis. \n",

She was found to have patent stents, but she continued to deteriorate. She was placed on ECMO, and then was taken to the OR with vascular surgery for repair of her Left CFA, CFV, and EIA at the site of the previous IABP. TEE showed Ebsteins anomaly with markedly dilated RA/RV with focal RV hypokinesis, severe TR, small LV with focal inferior hypokinesis with EF > [NUM]%, trace MR, no AI. On [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] she was taken to the operating room where she underwent placement of and RVAD and removal of ECMO. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name [NUM]**] on epinephrine, milrinone, levophed and propofol as well as Nitric oxide. She developed fevers for which she was cultured and ID was consulted. Cultures remained negative, she was placed on broad antibiotic coverage. She remained intubated and paralyzed, with likely ARDS. She was seen by hematology for difficulty maintaining a therapeutic ptt and thrombocytopenia. She was HIT -, and the thrombocytopenia was thought to be secondary to the VAD as well as illness. She was started on tube feeds. Vascular continued to follow her for her groin incisions, which eventually required VAC dressing. Her sternal wound developed purulent draiange, and the wound was opened and a vac dressing was applied there as well. She remained on vanco, zosyn and flagyl. CT scan of head/chest abdomen/pelvis on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] was essentially negative for infection with the exception of a [NUM].[NUM] cm right groin fluid collection. There as no bleed or infarct on head CT. She was seen by optho for conjunctivitis and placed on erythromycin ointment. She continued to have fever and white count, but negative cultures. TEE on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] showed no eveidence of endocarditis. Her respiratory status improved and her sedation was weaned. CXR showed slow resolution of ARDS. Her zosyn was changed to meropenum given the continued fevers, as well as fluconazole for some yeast growth from her wounds. She remained febrile despite antibiotic change, however her white count began to improve. She was taken to the cath lab on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] for placement of a PA cath in preparation for RVAD weaning. Fevers continued, she remained on vanco, fluc, and ceftaz was started on [**[NUM]-[NUM]**]. On [**[NUM]-[NUM]**] she was found to have melena and HCT drop, and GI was consulted. Gastric lavage showed maroon/black but no fresh blood. She was started on a protonix drip. EGD showed blood in the stomach, and findings consistent with hemorrhagic gastritis. Her heparin was stopped and she was started on Dextran. Her LFTs increased, and then began to improve. Her [**Last Name (un) [NUM]**] was dc'd. Hepatitis serologies were sent.

She had a small right [**Male First Name (un) 2812**] drain for thoracotomy drainage. She was given Morphine and Toradol for good pain control. She was extubated overnight and remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1 mcg/kg/minute. She had a good blood pressure of 88/53 and sinus rhythm at 75 and temperature maximum of 99.9 postoperatively. White count rose to 13.0, hematocrit 25.2, and platelet count 303,000. Potassium 4.0, BUN 10, creatinine 0.6. She had coarse breath sounds which were decreased on the right. Her Foley and her chest tubes remained in place. Diet was advanced. She had been extubated and her [**Male First Name (un) 2812**] drain was placed to water seal and she remained on Neo-Synephrine drip overnight. This was weaned the following morning down to 0.25. Her hematocrit dropped slightly to 20.2, white count remained at 9.6. She finished her perioperative Vancomycin. Her creatinine was stable at 0.5. Her chest tube was discontinued. Repeat chest x-ray was done. She was hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm with a pressure of 110/58 and was transferred out to the floor. Lasix diuresis was begun. On the floor, the patient was evaluated by physical therapy to begin ambulation and activity tolerance and was seen by case management also for evaluation. Her Foley was removed that afternoon. On postoperative day #3, she did complain of some sharp right inner thigh pain with some activity. She was alert and oriented, began her aspirin, vitamins, iron and was restarted on her Celexa as well as Zantac. She was given Vitamin B6 for neurologic pain. Her aspirin was increased to 325 mg p.o. once daily. She was hemodynamically stable. Her weight was 88.2 kilograms. She was saturating 96% in room air. Her white count dropped to 8.0, her hematocrit rose to 25.4 and her creatinine remained stable at 0.7. She continued to work with physical therapy. She did have some incisional pain under her right breast, the site of her mini thoracotomy. This was treated with p.o. Percocet. She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. She was tolerating her p.o. well and was medicated for pain control. On postoperative day #4, her right inner thigh tingling decreased. She put out almost 6 liters of urine. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm. Her lungs were clear bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft, nontender. She was doing very well. The patient complained of a visual field deficit from the right [**Hospital Unit Name 82**] since surgery without prior history. On examination, appeared to be nontoxic. Her visual fields were intact. Her extraocular movements were intact. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact, and she had no neurologic deficit. Question was whether the patient had an embolic stroke at that time. A CT of the head was ordered. Neurology consultation was ordered and plans were for discharge were placed on hold, given the patient's complaint of right [**Hospital Unit Name 82**] blurriness. An ophthalmology consultation was obtained. The diagnosis was a small right macular area hemorrhage. Per initial consultation ophthalmology, it was recommended that the patient have a follow-up at her ophthalmologist in [**Location (un) **] or at the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Clinic in [**Doctor Last Name **], fifth floor. Telephone number was given to the patient, [**Telephone/Fax (2) 6809**], to make an appointment on Monday after discharge. On postoperative day #5, neurology saw the patient on [**2012-02-12**], after ophthalmology consultation. At the time, this was also noted about the sensory changes of her right thigh in the distribution of the femoral nerve and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Neurology recommended a state CT of the pelvis with stat coagulation studies to assess for retroperitoneal bleed as well as MRA of the brain with a stroke protocol to evaluate for any infarctions, either water shed or embolic, given her various neurologic complaints. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1263**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2797**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2327**], neurology attendings. Ophthalmology consultation was performed as previously noted. On postoperative day #5, the patient was then in sinus rhythm at 72, was stable hemodynamically, had trace peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA: Preoperative laboratory work as follows: White count [NUM].[NUM], hematocrit [NUM].[NUM], platelet count [NUM],[NUM]. PT [NUM].[NUM], PTT [NUM].[NUM] with an INR of [NUM].[NUM]. This was all approximately a week and one half preoperatively when the patient was still on Coumadin. Her urinalysis showed some hematuria with a small amount of bacteria. Sodium [NUM], potassium [NUM].[NUM], chloride [NUM], bicarbonate [NUM], BUN [NUM], creatinine [NUM].[NUM], with a blood sugar of [NUM], ALT [NUM], AST [NUM], alkaline phosphatase [NUM], total bilirubin [NUM].[NUM], total protein [NUM].[NUM], albumin [NUM].[NUM], globulin [NUM].[NUM]. HBA[NUM]C [NUM].[NUM]%. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. EKG showed sinus rhythm at [NUM] with nonspecific ST-T wave flattening. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, she had a heart rate of [NUM] and sinus rhythm with a blood pressure of [NUM]/[NUM], height [NUM] feet five inches tall, weight [NUM] pounds. She was in no apparent distress. She had no obvious skin lesions. Her extraocular movements were intact. The pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation. Her neck was supple. Her lungs were clear bilaterally without any rhonchi or rales. The heart was regular rate and rhythm, with S[NUM] and S[NUM] tones and no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Her extremities are warm and dry with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. She had no obvious varicosities. She was alert and oriented and grossly neurologically intact cranial nerves II through XII. She had [NUM]+ bilateral femoral, DP, PT and radial pulses and no carotid bruits. HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**], after stopping her Coumadin at home. On [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**], she underwent minimally invasive atrial septal defect repair through a mini right thoracotomy by Dr. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) [NUM]**] and was transferred to the Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on a Propofol drip. She had a small right [**Male First Name (un) [NUM]**] drain for thoracotomy drainage. She was given Morphine and Toradol for good pain control. She was extubated overnight and remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip at [NUM] mcg/kg/minute. She had a good blood pressure of [NUM]/[NUM] and sinus rhythm at [NUM] and temperature maximum of [NUM].[NUM] postoperatively. White count rose to [NUM].[NUM], hematocrit [NUM].[NUM], and platelet count [NUM],[NUM]. Potassium [NUM].[NUM], BUN [NUM], creatinine [NUM].[NUM]. She had coarse breath sounds which were decreased on the right. Her Foley and her chest tubes remained in place. Diet was advanced. She had been extubated and her [**Male First Name (un) [NUM]**] drain was placed to water seal and she remained on Neo-Synephrine drip overnight. This was weaned the following morning down to [NUM].[NUM]. Her hematocrit dropped slightly to [NUM].[NUM], white count remained at [NUM].[NUM]. She finished her perioperative Vancomycin. Her creatinine was stable at [NUM].[NUM]. Her chest tube was discontinued. Repeat chest x-ray was done. She was hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm with a pressure of [NUM]/[NUM] and was transferred out to the floor. Lasix diuresis was begun. On the floor, the patient was evaluated by physical therapy to begin ambulation and activity tolerance and was seen by case management also for evaluation. Her Foley was removed that afternoon. On postoperative day #[NUM], she did complain of some sharp right inner thigh pain with some activity. She was alert and oriented, began her aspirin, vitamins, iron and was restarted on her Celexa as well as Zantac. She was given Vitamin B[NUM] for neurologic pain. Her aspirin was increased to [NUM] mg p.o. once daily. She was hemodynamically stable. Her weight was [NUM].[NUM] kilograms. She was saturating [NUM]% in room air. Her white count dropped to [NUM].[NUM], her hematocrit rose to [NUM].[NUM] and her creatinine remained stable at [NUM].[NUM]. She continued to work with physical therapy. She did have some incisional pain under her right breast, the site of her mini thoracotomy. This was treated with p.o. Percocet. She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. She was tolerating her p.o. well and was medicated for pain control. On postoperative day #[NUM], her right inner thigh tingling decreased. She put out almost [NUM] liters of urine. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm. Her lungs were clear bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft, nontender. She was doing very well. The patient complained of a visual field deficit from the right [**Hospital Unit Name [NUM]**] since surgery without prior history. On examination, appeared to be nontoxic. Her visual fields were intact. Her extraocular movements were intact. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact, and she had no neurologic deficit. Question was whether the patient had an embolic stroke at that time. A CT of the head was ordered. Neurology consultation was ordered and plans were for discharge were placed on hold, given the patient's complaint of right [**Hospital Unit Name [NUM]**] blurriness. An ophthalmology consultation was obtained. The diagnosis was a small right macular area hemorrhage. Per initial consultation ophthalmology, it was recommended that the patient have a follow-up at her ophthalmologist in [**Location (un) **] or at the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Clinic in [**Doctor Last Name **], fifth floor. Telephone number was given to the patient, [**Telephone/Fax ([NUM]) [NUM]**], to make an appointment on Monday after discharge. On postoperative day #[NUM], neurology saw the patient on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**], after ophthalmology consultation. At the time, this was also noted about the sensory changes of her right thigh in the distribution of the femoral nerve and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Neurology recommended a state CT of the pelvis with stat coagulation studies to assess for retroperitoneal bleed as well as MRA of the brain with a stroke protocol to evaluate for any infarctions, either water shed or embolic, given her various neurologic complaints. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name[NUM] (NamePattern[NUM]) [NUM]**] [**Last Name (NamePattern[NUM]) [NUM]**] and Dr. [**First Name[NUM] (NamePattern[NUM]) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern[NUM]) [NUM]**], neurology attendings. Ophthalmology consultation was performed as previously noted. On postoperative day #[NUM], the patient was then in sinus rhythm at [NUM], was stable hemodynamically, had trace peripheral edema. Her thoracotomy incision was clean, dry and intact. Her pacing wires had been removed. Her central venous line was out. MRI was performed, awaiting final result. The MR scan was negative per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) [NUM]**], and the patient was neurologically cleared. The patient was also evaluated to go home with VNA services by case management. The patient was instructed to follow-up with ophthalmologist and was discharged home with VNA services on [**[NUM]-[NUM]-[NUM]**]. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post minimally invasive atrial septal defect repair. Status post cerebrovascular accident. Right macular hemorrhage. Depression. Status post cesarean section x[NUM]. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: [NUM].

He was then re-transfered to the ICU for acute bradycardia with hypotension and unresponsiveness.  The bradycardia and hypotension was felt to be due to IV lopressor effect, and possibly due to pneumonia and sepsis.  An ABG at that time returned 6.94/151/101 and he was emergently intubated.  Femoral central access was obtained and he was transiently on Levophed for pressure support.  He was intubated from [**03-25**] - [**03-28**], and his mental status then resolved after treating his hypercapnea and pneumonia.  He was continued on a course of levaquin for staph aureus pneumonia, and his mental status remained stable.  He was re-evaluated by neurology after his mental status improved and was felt to have no focal neurologic deficits.  In fact, there was sufficient doubt as to whether or not he actually had a stroke on presentation since no evidence of a stroke was ever found.  His mental status changes may have been due to sepsis and respiratory failure - toxic/metabolic etiologies.\n",
